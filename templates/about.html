    <h1>What the heck is this?</h1>
    <p>A dead simple code snippet sharing tool.</p>

    <h2>Where's the code?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/carc1n0gen/quickpaste">It's right here!</a></p>

    <h2>Help! I'm a terminal hipster!</h2>
    <pre><code class="terminal-command">cat file-name | curl -H "X-Respondwith: link" -X POST -d "text=$(&lt;/dev/stdin)" {{host_url}}</code></pre>

    <small>The "X-Respondwith: link" is important.  Otherwise you will get a redirect response.</small>

    <h2>This looks supicously similar to <a href="https://hastebin.com/" target="_blank">another paste tool I know about</a></h2>
    <p>That's because the look and feel of this paste tool is very inspired by that one (I'm not a good designer). But I wrote this from scratch.</p>
